Spectral series data-sets

This folder contains spectral data, which is deliberated in the paper Sneppen et al. (2024), "Unified spectral series of the kilonova AT2017gfo:  Emergence and evolution of spectral features from \rprocess elements"

Spectra from the 6.5\,meter Magellan Telescopes (0.49 and 0.53\,days) located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, can be found at: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05432}. The 0.92\,day spectra were obtained with the Australian National University (ANU) the 2.3\,meter telescope located at Siding Spring Observatory. The 1.17\,day data obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) under the Director’s Discretionary Time programme 2017-1-DDT-009, are available at \url{https://ssda.saao.ac.za} with the newly reduced spectra (e.g. with improved flux-calibration now publically available here. X-shooter data from European Space Observatory (ESO) telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under programmes 099.D-0382 (principal investigator [PI]: E.~Pian), 099.D-0622 (PI: P.~D’Avanzo), 099.D-0376 (PI: S.~J.~Smartt), which are available at \url{http://archive.eso.org} and WISeREP (\url{https://wiserep.weizmann.ac.il/}). The re-reduced X-shooter spectra examining evolution in sub-epoch exposures at 1.4 days are made available here for the first time. \emph{HST} observations were obtained using programs GO~14771 (PI: N.~Tanvir), GO~14804 (PI: A.~Levan), GO~14850 (PI: E.~Troja).
