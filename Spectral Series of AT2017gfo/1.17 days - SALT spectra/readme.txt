For particular details on the various reductions (which uses different standard stars) see appendix in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08730

Recommended reduction for future analysis is "SALT_new_eg1_flux_calibrated_r+i.txt", which uses the standard star taken on the same night -- and determines flux normalisation from r+i bands. This flux calibration is consistent with blackbody extrapolation to SWIFT UV photometric data points.
