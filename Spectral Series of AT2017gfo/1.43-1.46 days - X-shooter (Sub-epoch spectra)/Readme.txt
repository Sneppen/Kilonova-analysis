This folder contains the new reductions of the AT2017gfo X-shooter spectra presented in Sneppen et al (2023), "Kilonova evolution â€” the rapid emergence of spectral features", in prep. 

The standard reduction averaging over all exposures are from Pian et al. (2017), Smartt et al. (2017). 
This new reduction present the sub-epoch evolution for the individual exposures (which comprise the epoch 1 reduction), to highlight the rapid evolution undergone over the roughly 1 hour of observations.
