# Kilonova-analysis

This folder contains the analysis of AT2017gfo

### The parameters of the fit: 
N, Overall normalisation describes ratio between intrinsic luminosity of blackbody and observed luminosity

T, Blackbody Temperature

#### P-cygni parameters
𝑣_𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑣_𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑡: Describes overall velocity, sets wavelength-scale

𝑣_𝑒, 𝜏: Velocity stratification and optical depth of line 𝜏(𝑣)=𝜏𝑒^(−(𝑣_𝑟𝑒𝑓−𝑣)/𝑣_𝑒 )

𝑂_𝑜𝑐𝑐: sets asymmetry between absorption and emission
