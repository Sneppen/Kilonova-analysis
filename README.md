# Kilonova-analysis

This folder contains the spectral modelling of the kilonova (KN) AT2017gfo presented in the paper, Sneppen et al (2023), "Spherical symmetry in the kilonova AT2017gfo/GW170817", Nature, 614.

Relatively simple models have proven quite succesfull in describing the observed properties of AT2017gfo. The continuum is well-modelled as a blackbody (see observational constraints in Sneppen et al (2023) "On the Blackbody Spectrum of Kilonovae", ApJ, 1955). Spectral perturbation from the blackbody (e.g. Absorption below 390 nm, P Cygni at 760 nm and 1 000 nm) follow from the strongest transitions of a light r-process atmosphere. These features are produced by abundant elements (r-process peak elements) positioned at leftmost part of the periodic table (due to their low partition functions - analogous to the Na, Mg, Ca lines in solar spectra or Ca lines in SNe). 

The folder "Spectral Series of AT2017gfo" contains the spectral series analysed in Sneppen et al (2024) "Unified spectral series of the kilonova AT2017gfo: Emergence and evolution of spectral features from r-process elements". Within this folder, we also include the "sub-epoch spectra" which are the re-reduced X-shooter epoch 1 spectrum of AT2017gfo. Here, the individual exposures have been reduced seperately to examine the short-timescale rapid evolution. The constraint from this derivative-evolution is detailed in Sneppen et al (2024), "Kilonova evolution â€” the rapid emergence of spectral features".
